Defined is a RAILS app for searching word defintions and saving the results in one easy to reference place.

I decided to learn Bootstrap by using it on this project for the front end design. The Project also uses the Merriam-Webster API.

Features I would like to add:

A remember me checkout on login

Clean up display of defintions. XML from API has tags that need to be replaced with other characters, as well as removing stray extra characters.

Would like to remove tags from the definition before saving to the database instead of scrubbing them afterwards

Add the second defintion

Continue Styling

Fix view issues at different sizes

Optimize view for mobile
